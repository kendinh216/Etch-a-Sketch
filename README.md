Etch-a-Sketch Project

Open project here: https://kendinh216.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/etch-a-sketch.html

About:
This is a web-based sketch pad that mimics the oldschool toy "etch-a-sketch".
Users will hover the mouse pointer over the sketch to draw and they can change colors or use random color button to randomize the color of the cells. The size of the sketch can be assigned by the user. 

Idea for project is from The Odin Project curriculum.
